    <h3> About Me </h3>
    
    <p>
    	Hi my name is Captain Awesome Kedar-Jones Shufflebottom, I'm named after my uncle the famous bounty hunter, you won't have heard of him since all evidence of his work was covered up during the cold war. All my friends call me Kedar because its easier. In my spare time I enjoy the touch of women which goes hand in hand with my career as a porn star under the name Dirk Kielbasa.

	<h3> Why am I here? </h3>
	
	<p>
		I am here because I have always had a curiosity towards how things work. In this day and age the internet has become such an integral part of our daily lives. It is a piece of technology the whole human race is now so reliant on. To me, with such a dependence on a technology it would be silly to not understand how it works and how to develop for it. Also I am pursuing a CS Minor as well so this course pretty much is perfect.
