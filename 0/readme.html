        For this assignment, I set up a server through Amazon Web Services. After completing all the proper updates, files, and permissions, I created an index.html file in the /var/www/html directory that would serve as my site's launch page. I then created a "0" folder in that directory that would act as a directory for Assignment 0. In that folder, I created an index.html file that would act as the main page for the assignment, and a readme.html file that would document the work.

        Extra credit:<br>
        - On the main launch page I added a navigation system to select links to the semester's assignments and their readmes.<br>
        - On the assignment page, I added a link back to the main launch page.<br>
        - On the assignment page, I added a little UR-themed logic puzzle in place of a joke.<br>
        - I styled all pages the 1990s way using basic CSS.
